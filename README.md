# SVM-with-Kernels
Support Vector Machines (SVM) with kernels

<p>Handle Missing Values and Outliers</p> 
<p>Produce Q-Q Plots and Histograms of the features, and apply the transformations.</p>

<p>Apply suitable feature coding techniques.</p>
<p>Scale and/or standardized the features, produce relevant graphs to show the
scaling/ standardizing effect.</p>
<p>Apply feature discretization, and produce a relevant graph to
show the discretization</p>
<p>Appropriately use PCA (Principal Component Analysis)</p> 
<p>Identify significant and independent features using appropriate techniques.</p>
<p>Show how you selected the features using suitable graphs.</p>
<p>Apply the Support Vector Machines (SVM) with kernels to predict the value of Y for the test dataset </p>
